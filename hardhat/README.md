# Build an NFT-powered fully on-chain DAO to invest in NFT collections as a group

You want to launch a DAO for holders of your NFT Collection - CryptoDevs. From the ETH that was gained through the sale of the NFTs, you have built up a treasury. The DAO now has a lot of ETH, but currently does nothing with it.

You want to allow your NFT holders to create and vote on proposals to use that ETH for purchasing other NFTs from an NFT marketplace, and speculate on price. Maybe in the future when you sell the NFT back, you split the profits among all members of the DAO.

## üìù Requirements

-   Anyone who owns a CryptoDevs NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace

-   Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals

-   Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal

-   Voters cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT

-   If majority of the voters vote in favor of the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase happens automatically from the marketplace
